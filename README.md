## Subheading
### Subsubheading

Here is a random paragraph of text.

This will be another paragraph.

That's right, new lines are respected!

It's a small detail but maybe the best thing about markdown.


# Most of Markdown

## Emphasis

We have _italics_ and __bold__.

You can also *italics* and **bold**.

I would use _this_ for italics and **this** for bold.

Can you guess what three of them do?

It's ___this___ or ***this***.

## Lists

* groucho
* harpo
* chico

- groucho
- harpo

## Code

You can talk about variables or functions like `document.getElementById` in the midst of your paragraph.

Perhaps `console.log` will help you debug.

For longer bits of code, use triple backticks:

```javascript
const hey = function () {
    console.log('heyyy');
};
```

```python
def hey():
    print("Heyyy")
```
